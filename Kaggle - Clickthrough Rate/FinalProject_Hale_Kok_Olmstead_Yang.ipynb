    "When it comes to making money off the internet, few things drive revenue like display advertisement. Getting the right product in front of the right people can be beneficial to the brand and consumer alike, but to do so is no easy task. Criteo works with over 4,000 e-commerce companies around the world and utilizes an algorithmic machine learning approach on an endless stream of user and advertisement data in an attempt to show the right ads to any given user. As an extension of this goal, CriteoLabs  shared a week's worth of data as a machine learning challenge to develop an algorithm which can accurately predict the click-through-rate (CTR). The CTR simply describes the probability that a given user on a given webpage would click on a given ad. The idea of a CTR can be further expressed by looking at the data provided by CriteoLabs. An example of this is shown at the end of the `Get the Data` section of this notebook."

    "As part of a Kaggle competition, CriteoLabs provided a week's worth of anonymized, labeled data: nearly 45 million rows of ad displays with 39 fields of attendant information and a record of whether that display resulted in a click. The columns are comprised of 13 integer columns that mostly represent count features as well as 26 columns that represent categorical features. For anonymization purposes, the values of these categorical features have been hashed onto 32 bits. We are not told what each of the 39 features represent because Criteo would like to keep their feature selection a secret. However, it is implied that together, the 39 features represent a certain user, the web page that the user is on, as well as a certain ad to which the user is exposed. With these 39 features, our goal is to come up with a machine learning algorithm in order to predict the probability that the ad will be clicked by the user on that webpage (click-through-rate). Along the development phase of our machine learning algorithm, we will be highlighting the following course concepts that was relevant to this task: scalability, bias/variance tradeoff, and feature engineering and selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we seek to answer is this:  **Within the memory constraints of our standard GCP cluster, what is the optimal combination of features, interactions and parameters to predict a click using Logistic Regression?**  The given data has labels that are approximately 75% 0s, so in order to beat a \"dummy\" algorithm that simply predicts '0' with 100 % probability every time, we will need our accuracy to be greater than 75% to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a binary logistic regression classifier, which will output a label of 0 (no click) or 1 (click), based on the calculated probability of a click. Since we do not know the meaning of the columns provided, we are limited to conduct our feature engineering by evaluating performance on a development set of data, instead of making choices informed by subject-matter hypotheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in a model that can confidently predict when a click will occur as well as when it will not. In addition to the accuracy, which only evaluates how many predictions are correct, we will evaluate our models using the f1-score, the log-loss, and the confusion matrix. We want to maximize the f1-score, minimize the log-loss, and increase the confidence with which the models predict clicks. In order to have a useful model, we must beat the dummy classifier on all of these metrics."

    "Finally, we wanted to look at temporal patterns in the data.  The README provided by Criteo tells us the records are in chronological order, but none of these fields looks like a timestamp - even in the categoricals. If any of them were a timestamp you would expect to see a repeating pattern in the values, but we couldn't discern one.  As part of feature engineering we'll be adding a daypart column to try and correct this, but we wanted to see if the simple presence of data in the columns showed a pattern."

We assigned a monotonically increasing index to the entire training data, broke that range into seven chunks, divided each chunk in 24 parts, then wrote a UDF to go through, examine each row's ID and determine which daypart it should go into.  While each day contains a different number of rows, this technique makes buckets that are large enough to capture the repeating volume pattern of clicks. "

    "For the NAs on the numerical columns we have, we decided to impute to the mean from each of those columns. However, we considered that the missing data points are not occuring at random, and that there may be some self-selection bias occurring at the end user level. For example: users omitting information fields, changing their privacy settings, or even deleting their cookies. Simply imputing to the mean would cause us to be missing out on information on the type of users described above. To get around this, we also created an indicator feature for each of the integer columns to indicate whether the record was complete or missing values. Testing indicated that field `C22` also benefited from having one of these columns. For the categorical columns on the other hand, we decided to impute `col_name + _no_value` for each of the records where the information is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For scaling, we first split the data in `train.txt` into a train and test set. We then normalized each of the numerical feature to have unit standard deviation and zero mean. For the scaling, we calculated the mean and standard deviation prior to imputing the values. However we ran onto some issues with the built-in `StandardScaler`, and `VectorAssembler` functions within the spark-ml library. The built-in functions cannot handle a feature with missing values, and there are plenty here. So instead, we scaled the numerical features with Spark SQL as shown below."

The `HandleInvalid` attribute is set to `keep`, which will add the last, `Unseen` category. This way, when we transform a dataset that contains a country that was not in the training set, we will have somewhere to keep the information. \n",

    "To add interactions, we use the RFormula, which creates a list of feature values in the following order: [NZ, CA, US, Unseen, Hour, NZ\\*Hour, CA\\*Hour, US\\*Hour, Unseen\\*Hour]. Here, `hour` should be scaled so that we avoid convergence issues with gradient descent.\n",

For example, one of the numericals might be number of times this user has visited this site, while one of the categoricals might be the referring URL, and perhaps heavy users of _this_ site who just came from _that_ site are more likely to click on a particular ad. In order to examine that, we would need an interaction term.\n",

Again, using different samples of data, we tested the addition of the interactions to the overall regression one-by-one, and kept track of those that had a positive effect on score.  From this we determined a list of interactions that, in isolation, were beneficial:  [C5/C17, C6/C17, C8/C17, C14/C17, C17/C20, C17/C22].\n",

    "All of our models beat the dummy classifier, but in different ways. Perhaps the most important, the ability to predict clicks and not simply the majority class (0s), is best exhibited by the model that is trained on balanced data. When we train on an unbalanced dataset, our model becomes essentially a very expensive majority class predictor. That is, it is very hesitant to predict clicks, and instead predicts no clicks for most of the observations. The f1-score is best for the model that is trained on the balanced data, no matter the data for which we are making predictions. \n"

    "## 5.1 Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this work, we have conciously chosen to work with dataframes and the dataframe API in Spark Mllib over working with hand-coded implementations with RDDs. We will refer to the dataframe API in Spark Mllib as Spark ML. Typically, using RDDs coded in Python would allow greater flexibility, but at the cost of serialization/deserialization of the data and code to something Spark can understand. User defined functions (UDFs) suffer from the same setback. Although UDFs may allow for additional flexibility, they require serialization of the data, adding an additional step, and reducing performance. Using Spark ML allows us to take advantage of the optimized functions under the hood, written in Scala to improve performance at scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Spark ML provides additional benefits. The Pandas integration is quite convenient for visualization during the EDA as well as printing output cleanly. The pipelining afforded by the Spark ML API allows for easy to follow fits and transformations on train and test datasets. Spark ML has many optimized, built in methods that will be more performant than UDFs. Additionally, Spark has a SparkSQL API allowing for performant dataframe transformations at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "When scaling up it is important to guard against executor failure. We accomplish this by occaisional checkpointing in addition to caching of transformed dataframes. If an executor fails, all of the cached transformations go with it. Due to lazy evaluation the entire lineage will have to be reevaluated the next time an action is called on the transformed dataframe. This lineage can be examined in the logical and physical execution plans. Checkpointing saves a dataframe to a temporary location on the disk, so that in case of a failure, we can just read the dataframe from disk. This makes sense when reading from disk is faster than reevaluating all of the transformations previously performed."

    "We have done quite a bit of feature engineering and selection, presented above, and in the supplementary notebook. For this exercise we had both categorical and numerical columns. For the categorical columns, we created additional features by one-hot encoding. That is, we created a binary column for each unique feature in the categorical fields, encoding each unique feature with a 1 in the feature column, or a 0 if the datapoint took on a different value in the field. One-hot encoded features can then be fed into the logistic regression that we trained. One-hot encoding can result in a tremendous number of features if each field has many unique values, since a single column is created for each unique value. In the particular subset of data we used for EDA, one-hot encoding each of the categorical columns would result in almost 100,000 features. Because of this, we carefully pruned the fields and features to include in our model. We selected which features to keep both as a result of EDA and an optimization function that evaluated many different combinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the numerical columns, we standardized the vectors by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each column, imputed missing values to the mean, and also added a second column for each numerical feature (and one categorical feature) indicating whether a value was present or not. It is important to standardize the vectors this way so that gradient descent will converge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we were told the data was in chronological order but could not discern a field that looked like a timestamp, we created a `daypart` column to approximate a 24-hour timestamp using a combination of approximation and calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we could feed these features into the logistic regression, we also evaluated the interactions of the fields we had in the initial dataset. It is possible, however,that by including all of the two-way interactions we would end up with an enormous number of features. It would have been possible to implement some sort of field-aware matrix factorization method that would have found latent vectors instead of fitting all of the interaction terms. However, we chose to focus on logistic regression for the sake of interpretability. For the logistic regression, a huge number of features and interactions would result in a model that is both expensive to train, and overfit to the training data. To counteract this, we did not fit all of the interactions, but rather a subset. A deeper discussion of model overfitting can be found in the next section around the bias/variance tradeoff."

    "## 5.3 Bias/Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "As models become more complex, the variance between models built with different subsets of data increases. On the other hand, models that are too simple have high bias, or large difference between the true value and the average predicted value for any input. The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the need to find the optimal model with complexity that leads to both acceptable variance and bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "When examining error, we can \"decompose\" it into components from bias and variance in addition to the irreducible error.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Err = \\text{Bias}^2 + \\text{Variance} + \\text{Irreducible Error}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, imperfect models that are missing terms or include the incorrect terms lead to bias. Finite data leads to variance. Therefore, we must find the right balance between the two. The irreducible error is noise that enters the model that cannot be reduced by gathering more data or building a better model.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Err = \\left(E[\\hat{f}(x)]-f(x)\\right)^2 + E\\left[\\left(\\hat{f}(x)-E[\\hat{f}(x)]\\right)^2\\right] +\\sigma_e^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve balance between bias and variance, we can be careful about feature selection. In order to create a model that accurately predicts the output of interest, we must include features that are either directly correlated with the output, or correlated with the output when involved in an interaction with another feature. Including additional features will improve the accuracy on the training set, reducing bias, but including too many will increase the variance of the predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to regularize during gradient descent. Regularization discourages large coefficients by placing a penalty on the coefficients (equations 6-11). When gradient descent is performed with regularization, then the algorithm does not reach the absolute minimum loss for the training set of data, but instead provides a more generalizable model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping can also contribute to lowering the variance of a fitted model. If we do not allow gradient descent to minimize the loss function, but instead stop after a set and small number of iterations, we will fit a model with slightly higher bias, but hopefully with lower variance."

    "## The great #TODO list\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will address what we would do to continue this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we would implement a random forest model in addition to the logistic regression implemented above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we found the optimal model, we would save the model to file. This would allow predictions to be made very quickly for new observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we may want to go back and evaluate the data imputation that was done for the numerical features. We imputed to the mean, but it is also possible to use matrix factorization to fill in the null values for the numerical features."
