# Predicting click-through rate for Criteo
This was our final Project for UC Berkeley Master's class in distributed Machine Learning, in which we applied *Logistic Regression* in *Spark ML* to predict click-through rate on Criteo's banner ads. The data came from [this Kaggle challenege](https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge) and consisted of ~42 million rows of either numeric or hashed categorical data.

This was a group project.  My primary contributions were the Exploratory Data Analysis (in which I came up with a novel way to infer a missing timestamp column), Feature Selection and Optimization and some amount of Feature Engineering.  I have included all the relevant notebooks in this folder, but the full description of work can be found in the [Final Project notebook](Final Project.ipynb).
